        My name is Hector I am a web developer looking to expand my skills. I've gained good experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks like React in my current studies. The insurance industry taught me the importance of understanding user needs when designing interfaces. While I'm proud of my progress so far, I know I still have so much more to learn in this rapidly changing field.

        I have completed my certificate program at Arizona State University. The courses were challenging but rewarding, pushing me to grow as a developer. Although I've been able to pick up new systems quickly in the past, I understand that mastering web development requires ongoing effort. I still consider myself a student.

        With my logical thinking and desire to help people, I hope to someday create web solutions that make a real difference. I know listening closely to client needs is crucial. I look forward to transitioning into a full-time software engineering role where I can keep enhancing my skills. I'm eager to take on new challenges that will expand my coding abilities. Above all, I try to stay humble and open-minded. This field requires lifelong dedication and practice. But I'm up for the challenge! I can't wait to see where my web development journey takes me next.
