        Hi, I'm Hector, a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React. Through my ongoing development journey, I’ve honed my skills in building user-friendly, responsive web applications, always keeping the end-user’s experience in mind.

        <p>
        My background in the insurance industry has given me valuable insight into the importance of understanding user needs and designing intuitive interfaces. While I’m proud of my progress, I’m always focused on staying ahead in this fast-paced field, continuously expanding my skill set.
        </p>
        <p>
        I hold a certificate in Web Development from Arizona State University, where I tackled complex projects that have pushed me to grow as a developer. Though I’ve been able to quickly adapt to new technologies, I recognize that mastery in web development is an ongoing process, and I’m committed to further refining my expertise.
        </p>

        <p>
        I’m excited to transition into a full-time software engineering role, where I can contribute my logical thinking and problem-solving skills while continuing to enhance my development capabilities. I’m eager to tackle new challenges, collaborate with others, and create meaningful web solutions that truly make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
        My focus is on staying humble, open-minded, and dedicated to lifelong learning. The ever-evolving nature of web development keeps me motivated, and I look forward to seeing where this journey takes me next.
